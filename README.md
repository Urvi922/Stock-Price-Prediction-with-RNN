# Stock-prices-prediction-using-RNN-in-Python
* Employed RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) algorithms for future stock price prediction based on previous days prices 2015 to 2020 incorporating TensorFlow, Sklearn.
* Pre-processed data including variables volume, opening price and high and low prices were used to predicted stock price with LSTM, GRU and simple RNN algorithms.
* GRU proved to be more effective compared to other algorithms with MSE (Mean Square Error) 12.3, which mean predicted results were same as real values of those days.
